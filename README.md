# CS 1501 Project 0

## Specifications:
1. Create a new file `./app/src/main/java/cs1501_p0/Extra.java` that prints a brief message via `System.out.println()`.
	This message should include the string `"CS1501"` and be more than 20 characters, but less than 140 characters.
	Add this file to the git repository.
1. Change the String printed by `./app/src/main/java/cs1501_p0/Done.java` from `"NOT DONE"` to `"DONE"`.
1. Commit all changes to your repository.
1. Push your repository back to GitHub.

## Submission Guidelines:
* Be sure to remember to push the latest copy of your code back to your GitHub repository before the the assignment is due.  At the specified deadline, the repositories will automatically be copied for grading.  Whatever is present in your GitHub repository at that time will be considered your submission for this assignment.
* Do NOT add `./app/build/` to your repository.

## Additional Notes/Hints:
* The default file to run is `Done.java`, you can execute this by running `./gradlew run` on Linux or macOS (`gradlew.bat run` on Windows)
* There is no easy way to run `Extra.java`, but there are tests setup to check that it is working. Running `./gradlew test` on Linux or macOS (`gradlew.bat test` on Windows) will run the tests to check both `Done.java` and `Extra.java`.
* Don't forget to make `Extra.java` a part of the package `cs1501_p0`!
